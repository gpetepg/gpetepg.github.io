# Quick Personal Website For GitHub Pages
Here is a quick and easy template you can spin up for your [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site.

Features include a working navbar with a dropdown menu, links to Github, LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, your email and résumé.

By default the text is centered and the background image is static as you scroll.

# Setting Up GitHub Pages

1) Head over to GitHub and create a new repository named username.github.io, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.

2) Clone the repository.

3) After editing your changes here, add the project files into the repository.

4) Push and you're done!
